• Designed algorithm to construct EURUSD FX volatility surface from market strategy volatilities (risk-reversal, ATM, market strangle) quoted using spot/forward delta and DNS ATM conventions.
    Employed SABR for smile modeling and flat-forward volatility approach for temporal interpolation.
    
• Made extensive use of optimization algorithms to convert quoted data (delta/maturity) in call/put volatilities (strike/tenor) and capture the volatility surface dynamics.
